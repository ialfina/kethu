We revised and converted an Indonesian constituency treebank created by [Dinakaramani et al (2015)](https://github.com/famrashel/idn-treebank) from Universitas Indonesia to the Penn Treebank format, a de-facto standard in creating the constituency treebank.

_Note: We borrowed the treebank name from  [a forest in Wonosobo](http://wiki-wisata.blogspot.com/2014/08/hutan-alas-kethu-wonogiri.html). Why a forest? Because the treebank contains parse trees, as the forest contains trees_ ;-)
